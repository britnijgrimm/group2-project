# group2-project
Final Project for Dataviz Bootcamp

WE have decided to use No show appointments database and here is the dataflow will be;


1- we will upload the data to S3

  the connection between S3 and pandas need to be crated and keys need to be hidden

2- The data brought down to Panda's need to be manupulated,
    
3-Manupulated and cleaned data needs to be sent to sql database to be hold.

4-Everyone should pull the data from AWS-SQL server and use it, for machine learning, datadashboard, charts...

So far we have only one table and we have been working with that table once we complete info compiling on teh second table we wil add the second table. 

At this point from noshowappointments.csv file we have created mockup datasheet called (processeddata.csv)  so that machine learning data could be plugged in.
