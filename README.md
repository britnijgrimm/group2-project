  ### Pulling Data and Woking with Data 

We pulled the data from AWS with orginal connection;

Lattidue and Longitude field needed some attention.  We had to split lat,long field on Neighbourhood_data table also change the data type from text to geographical.

Then we created different dashbords with income, age, gender, vs No show data and created our storybord. 
You can access the dashbourd at following address.
