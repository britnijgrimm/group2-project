# Final Project
## Group 2: Miguel Diaz, Maya Singh, Ren Yildiz, and Britni Grimm
*Final Project for Dataviz Bootcamp*

### Communication Protcols
Because one of our members is located in India, we plan to communicate through WhatsApp and meet one to two times per week via Zoom to discuss challenges, progress and request feedback from the team.

### Presentation
**Selected topic:** Attendance data for medical appointments in Brazil
**Reason why they selected their topic:** Miguel already had the data set in mind. Medical services are necessary for our health and well-being.
**Description of their source of data:** Dataset is available on Kaggle. Data provided by Aquarela Advanced Analytics (Brazil).
**Questions they hope to answer with the data:**
- Which neighborhood regions have higher attendance rates for appointments? Can this predict demand for physician services?
- If physicians can predict a certain percentage of no-shows for appointments, could they then schedule additional appointments for the day?
- Can physicians use this data to plan resources?
- Are there certain medical conditions that make patients more likely to show?
- Do age or gender correlate to no-show rates?
- Is Scholarship (social welfare programs) from the government encouraging patients to show for appointments?
- Do regular patients show up more than one-time patients? (This would need more data processing and we can consider it later)
