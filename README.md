**Selected topic:** Attendance data for medical appointments in Brazil

**Reason why they selected their topic:** Miguel already had the data set in mind. Medical services are necessary for our health and well-being.

**Description of their source of data:** Dataset is available on Kaggle. Data provided by Aquarela Advanced Analytics (Brazil).

**Questions they hope to answer with the data:**
- Which neighborhood regions have higher attendance rates for appointments? Can this predict demand for physician services?
- If physicians can predict a certain percentage of no-shows for appointments, could they then schedule additional appointments for the day?
- Can physicians use this data to plan resources?
- Are there certain medical conditions that make patients more likely to show?
- Do age or gender correlate to no-show rates?
- Is Scholarship (social welfare programs) from the government encouraging patients to show for appointments?
- Do regular patients show up more than one-time patients? (This would need more data processing and we can consider it later)
